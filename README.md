Homework for CSE 1002

This program depends on the StdDraw class from Princeton University. https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/

When compiling and running, be sure to specify the classpath using `-cp /path/to/stdlib.jar`

Please forgive the excessive usage of the `final` modifier.  My professor has strict rules concerning "style."
